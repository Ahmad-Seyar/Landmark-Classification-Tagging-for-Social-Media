# Landmark-Classification-Tagging-for-Social-Media
In this project, you will harness your Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) skills to construct a landmark classifier that holds the potential to revolutionize image localization in the realm of photo sharing and storage services.

Modern photo-sharing and storage platforms thrive on location data, a key ingredient for enhancing user experiences. This data empowers advanced features, including auto-tag suggestions and automated photo organization, ensuring users have an engaging journey through their digital memories. However, a significant challenge arises when an image lacks location metadata, often due to a camera's absence of GPS capabilities or privacy-related metadata removal.

To overcome this hurdle, the project introduces a game-changing approach: detecting and classifying distinctive landmarks within an image to predict its location. Considering the sheer volume of images uploaded globally, manually assigning landmarks becomes impractical.

The project unfolds in three pivotal steps:

Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (from Scratch): Here, you will embark on the journey of dataset visualization, data preprocessing, and the development of a CNN from the ground up. This network's primary purpose is to classify landmarks. You'll delve into your decision-making process behind data processing and network architecture. The ultimate aim is to export your best-performing network using Torch Script.

Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (using Transfer Learning): This phase delves into exploring pre-trained models and selecting the most suitable one for landmark classification. You'll leverage transfer learning to fine-tune your chosen network for this specific task. The process involves both training and testing, all while elucidating your rationale for opting for a particular pre-trained network. Again, you will export your optimal transfer learning solution using Torch Script.

Deploy your algorithm in an app: The final stride entails utilizing your most successful model to craft a user-friendly application. This app allows users to employ your model in pinpointing landmarks in images. Through rigorous testing and personal interaction with your model, you'll discern its strengths and weaknesses.

Three dedicated Jupyter Notebooks, thoughtfully provided in the project starter kit, guide you through these phases, encapsulating a comprehensive journey from image data to a deployable AI-powered solution. This project endeavors to revolutionize the way we approach image localization, bringing us closer to fully automated and intelligent image management.
